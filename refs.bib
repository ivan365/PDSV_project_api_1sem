  abstractnote = {Understanding how a computer or rather a CPU works can be a bit tricky and hard to understand. We live today in a society full of computers and there are many who do not understand how a CPU works. This project is aimed to understand how a CPU works and the architecture behind it. For this it is demonstrated the fundamental theory behind it but also a practical computer that has been built from scratch. This computer can demonstrate the theory behind how the CPU works and also how it communicates. This computer is 8-bit which has it limitations but can show the fundamental theory behind how computers work.},
